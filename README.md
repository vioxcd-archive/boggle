Answering [this question from codefess twt](https://twitter.com/codingfess/status/1439220133512335365)

I'm a noob & I have some time to spend, so I guess why not

I included the picture of the question in the repo, if you want to try by yourself, you could see my initial commit where I wrote down the board and keywords for you;)

For those who want a (maybe) cleaner solution, check out this [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boggle-find-possible-words-board-characters/) page (I did the question on my own, and came up to a somewhat similar answer, though maybe more complicated, I gave comments about what I'm trying to do (good luck figuring out what the comments meant))
